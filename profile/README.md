## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Austin Machine Learning (ML) Journal Club! We are a group of ML practitioners in Austin, TX. Once a month we read an ML paper together and have an in-person discussion. If you are interested in learning about how our journal club works and how to join, please visit our [blog](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io)'s [Tips](https://austinmljournalclub.github.io/readme.html) page.

Out blog is hosted by GitHub Pages and it uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) platform. Journal club members contribute by writing blog posts about paper summaries, and reviewing the PRs of the posts. If you want to know more about our journal club and future events, please visit our [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/austin-ml-journal-club/) page.
